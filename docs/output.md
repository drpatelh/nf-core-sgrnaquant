# nf-core/sgrnaquant: Output

This document describes the output produced by the pipeline. Most of the plots are taken from the MultiQC report, which summarises results at the end of the pipeline.

## Pipeline overview
The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/). See [`main README.md`](../README.md) for a condensed overview of the steps in the pipeline, and the bioinformatics tools used at each step.

See [Illumina website](https://www.illumina.com/techniques/popular-applications/genome-editing.html) for more information regarding the applications of various CRISPR-based protocols, and for an extensive list of publications.

The directories listed below will be created in the output directory after the pipeline has finished. All paths are relative to the top-level results directory.

## Library-level analysis

The initial QC and alignments are performed at the library-level e.g. if the same library has been sequenced more than once to increase sequencing depth. This has the advantage of being able to assess each library individually, and the ability to process multiple libraries from the same sample in parallel.

1. **Raw read QC**

    *Documentation*:  
    [FastQC](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/)  

    *Description*:  
    FastQC gives general quality metrics about your reads. It provides information about the quality score distribution across your reads, the per base sequence content (%A/C/G/T). You get information about adapter contamination and other overrepresented sequences.  

    *Output directories*:  
    * `fastqc/`  
    FastQC `*.html` files for read 1 (*and read2 if paired-end*) **before** adapter trimming.  
    * `fastqc/zips/`  
    FastQC `*.zip` files for read 1 (*and read2 if paired-end*) **before** adapter trimming.  

2. **Adapter trimming**

    *Documentation*:  
    [Trim Galore!](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/)

    *Description*:  
    Trim Galore! is a wrapper tool around Cutadapt and FastQC to consistently apply quality and adapter trimming to FastQ files. By default, Trim Galore! will automatically detect and trim the appropriate adapter sequence. See [`usage.md`](usage.md) for more details about the trimming options.

    ![MultiQC - Cutadapt trimmed sequence plot](images/mqc_cutadapt_plot.png)

    *Output directories*:
    * `trim_galore/`  
      If `--saveTrimmed` is specified FastQ files **after** adapter trimming will be placed in this directory.
    * `trim_galore/logs/`  
      `*.log` files generated by Trim Galore!.
    * `trim_galore/fastqc/`  
      FastQC `*.html` files for read 1 (*and read2 if paired-end*) **after** adapter trimming.
    * `trim_galore/fastqc/zips/`  
      FastQC `*.zip` files for read 1 (*and read2 if paired-end*) **after** adapter trimming.

3. **Alignment**

    *Documentation*:  
    [BWA](http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/bwa.shtml), [SAMtools](http://samtools.sourceforge.net/)

    *Description*:  
    Adapter-trimmed reads are mapped to the reference assembly using BWA. A genome index is required to run BWA so if this is not provided explicitly using the `--bwa_index` parameter then it will be created automatically from the genome fasta input. The index creation process can take a while for larger genomes so it is possible to use the `--saveGenomeIndex` parameter to save the indices for future pipeline runs, reducing processing times.

    ![MultiQC - SAMtools stats plot](images/mqc_samtools_stats_plot.png)

    File names in the resulting directory (i.e. `bwa/library/`) will have the '`.Lb.`' (**L**i**b**rary) suffix.

    *Output directories*:
    * `bwa/library/`  
      The files resulting from the alignment of individual libraries are not saved by default so this directory will not be present in your results. You can override this behaviour with the use of the `--saveAlignedIntermediates` flag in which case it will contain the coordinate sorted alignment files in [`*.bam`](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf) format.
    * `bwa/library/samtools_stats/`  
      SAMtools `*.flagstat`, `*.idxstats` and `*.stats` files generated from the alignment files.

## Merged library-level analysis

The library-level alignments associated with the same sample are merged and subsequently used for the downstream analyses.

1. **Alignment merging, duplicate marking, filtering and QC**

    *Documentation*:  
    [picard](https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/command-line-overview.html), [SAMtools](http://samtools.sourceforge.net/), [BEDTools](https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [BAMTools](https://github.com/pezmaster31/bamtools/wiki/Tutorial_Toolkit_BamTools-1.0.pdf), [Pysam](https://pysam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html), [Preseq](http://smithlabresearch.org/software/preseq/)

    *Description*:  
    Picard MergeSamFiles and MarkDuplicates are used in combination to merge the alignments, and for the marking of duplicates, respectively. If you only have one library for any given replicate then the merging step isnt carried out because the library-level and merged library-level BAM files will be exactly the same.

    Read duplicate marking is carried out using the Picard MarkDuplicates command. Duplicate reads are generally removed from the aligned reads to mitigate for fragments in the library that may have been sequenced more than once due to PCR biases. There is an option to keep duplicate reads with the `--keepDups` parameter but its generally recommended to remove them to avoid the wrong interpretation of the results. A similar option has been provided to keep reads that are multi-mapped - `--keepMultiMap`. Other steps have been incorporated into the pipeline to filter the resulting alignments - see [`main README.md`](../README.md) for a more comprehensive listing, and the tools used at each step.


    A selection of alignment-based QC metrics generated by Picard CollectMultipleMetrics and MarkDuplicates will be included in the MultiQC report.

    ![MultiQC - Picard deduplication stats plot](images/mqc_picard_deduplication_plot.png)

    ![MultiQC - Picard insert size plot](images/mqc_picard_insert_size_plot.png)  

    The Preseq package is aimed at predicting and estimating the complexity of a genomic sequencing library, equivalent to predicting and estimating the number of redundant reads from a given sequencing depth and how many will be expected from additional sequencing using an initial sequencing experiment. The estimates can then be used to examine the utility of further sequencing, optimize the sequencing depth, or to screen multiple libraries to avoid low complexity samples. The dashed line shows a perfectly complex library where total reads = unique reads.

    Note that these are predictive numbers only, not absolute. The MultiQC plot can sometimes give extreme sequencing depth on the X axis - click and drag from the left side of the plot to zoom in on more realistic numbers.

    ![MultiQC - Preseq library complexity plot](images/mqc_preseq_plot.png)  

    File names in the resulting directory (i.e. `bwa/mergedLibrary/`) will have the '`.mLb.`' suffix to denote **m**erged **L**i**b**raries.

    *Output directories*:
    * `bwa/mergedLibrary/`  
      Merged library-level, coordinate sorted `*.bam` files after the marking of duplicates, and filtering based on various criteria. The file suffix for the final filtered files will be `*.mLb.clN.*`. If you specify the `--saveAlignedIntermediates` parameter then two additional sets of files will be present. These represent the unfiltered alignments with duplicates marked (`*.mLb.mkD.*`), and in the case of paired-end datasets the filtered alignments before the removal of orphan read pairs (`*.mLb.flT.*`).
    * `bwa/mergedLibrary/samtools_stats/`  
      SAMtools `*.flagstat`, `*.idxstats` and `*.stats` files generated from the alignment files.
    * `bwa/mergedLibrary/picard_metrics/`  
      Alignment QC files from picard CollectMultipleMetrics and the metrics file from MarkDuplicates: `*_metrics` and `*.metrics.txt`, respectively.
    * `bwa/mergedLibrary/picard_metrics/pdf/`  
      Alignment QC plot files in `*.pdf` format from picard CollectMultipleMetrics.
    * `bwa/mergedLibrary/preseq/`  
      Preseq expected future yield file (`*.ccurve.txt`).

6. **Read counting and differential binding analysis**

    *Documentation*:  
    [featureCounts](http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/featureCounts/), [DESeq2](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html), [R](https://www.r-project.org/)

    *Description*:  
    The featureCounts tool is used to count the number of reads relative to the consensus peak-set across all of the samples. This essentially generates a file containing a matrix where the rows represent the consensus intervals, the columns represent all of the samples in the experiment, and the values represent the raw read counts.

    ![MultiQC - featureCounts consensus peak read assignment plot](images/mqc_featureCounts_assignment_plot.png)  

    DESeq2 is more commonly used to perform differential expression analysis for RNA-seq datasets. However, it can also be used for ChIP-seq differential binding analysis, in which case you can imagine that instead of counts per gene for RNA-seq data we now have counts per bound region.  

    This pipeline uses a standardised DESeq2 analysis script to get an idea of the reproducibility within the experiment, and to assess the overall differential binding. Please note that this will not suit every experimental design, and if there are other problems with the experiment then it may not work as well as expected.

    ![MultiQC - DESeq2 PCA plot](images/mqc_deseq2_pca_plot.png)  

    ![MultiQC - DESeq2 sample similarity plot](images/mqc_deseq2_sample_similarity_plot.png)  

    By default, all possible pairwise comparisons across the groups from a particular antibody (as defined in [`design.csv`](usage.md#--design)) are performed. The DESeq2 results are generated by the pipeline in various ways. You can load up the results across all of the comparisons in a single spreadsheet, or individual folders will also be created that contain the results specific to a particular comparison. For the latter, additional files will also be generated where the intervals have been pre-filtered based on a couple of standard FDR thresholds. Please see [DESeq2 output](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html#differential-expression-analysis) for a description of the columns generated by DESeq2.

## Aggregate analysis

1. **Present QC for the raw read, alignment, peak and differential binding results**

    *Documentation*:  
    [MultiQC](https://multiqc.info/docs/)

    *Description*:  
    MultiQC is a visualisation tool that generates a single HTML report summarising all samples in your project. Most of the pipeline QC results are visualised in the report and further statistics are available within the report data directory.  

    Results generated by MultiQC collate pipeline QC from FastQC, TrimGalore, samtools flagstat, samtools idxstats, samtools stats, picard CollectMultipleMetrics, picard MarkDuplicates, Preseq, deepTools plotProfile, deepTools plotFingerprint, phantompeakqualtools and featureCounts. The default [`multiqc config file`](../assets/multiqc/multiqc_config.yaml) also contains the provision for loading custom-content to report peak counts, FRiP scores, peak-to-gene annnotation proportions, spp NSC coefficient, spp RSC coefficient, PCA plots and sample-similarity heatmaps.  

    The pipeline has special steps which also allow the software versions to be reported in the MultiQC output for future traceability. For more information about how to use MultiQC reports, see <http://multiqc.info>.

    *Output directories*:
    * `multiqc/`  
      * `multiqc_report.html` - a standalone HTML file that can be viewed in your web browser.
      * `multiqc_data/` - directory containing parsed statistics from the different tools used in the pipeline.
      * `multiqc_plots/` - directory containing static images from the report in various formats.

## Other results

1. **Reference genome files**

    *Documentation*:  
    [BWA](https://sourceforge.net/projects/bio-bwa/files/), [BEDTools](https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [SAMtools](http://samtools.sourceforge.net/)

    *Description*:
    Reference genome-specific files can be useful to keep for the downstream processing of the results.

    *Output directories*:
    * `reference_genome/`  
      A number of genome-specific files are generated by the pipeline in order to aid in the filtering of the data, and because they are required by standard tools such as BEDTools. These can be found in this directory along with the genome fasta file which is required by IGV.
    * `reference_genome/BWAIndex/`  
      If the `--saveGenomeIndex` parameter is provided then the alignment indices generated by the pipeline will be saved in this directory. This can be quite a time-consuming process so it permits their reuse for future runs of the pipeline or for other purposes.
